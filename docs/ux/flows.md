## UX Flows and Wireflows

### FTUE (First Time User Experience)
1. Cold start → Cinematic stills (skippable) → Name settlement → Minimal HUD
2. Guided build: Place `Housing L1`, `Farm L1`, `Water Still L1`
3. First rescue: Tap Map → "Apartment Rescue" mission → Squad assembly (auto-fill) → Start
4. Mission brief: objectives, risks, rewards → RTwP tutorial (pause, move, ability)
5. Extraction → Return to base → Reward screen → New survivor joins
6. Night mini-siege: Place `Wooden Wall`, `Gate`, `Spike Trap`, `Turret` (loaned) → Defend 2 waves
7. Wrap-up: Tech tree intro → "What next" panel (3 suggested goals)

Key UX elements:
- Contextual coachmarks; animated arrows; dim out unrelated UI
- "Why" tips on stat checks and outcomes
- Safe-build preview (pathing visualization)

### Base Loop (Daily)
1. Collect resources (tap collectables and storage)
2. Assignment panel: survivors sorted by best-fit role; quick-assign; day/night schedules
3. Build/upgrade queue: surface bottlenecks (power, storage, caps); recommend next actions
4. Craft gear/consumables; equip recommended loadouts
5. Check world events and faction contracts
6. Set squad on mission; optional auto-resolve for trivial risk

UI modules:
- Dashboard card: power/net, morale trend, horde interest, storage caps
- Notifications: injuries, infections, shortages, sieges in N hours
- Activity log: condensed "what changed" feed

### Mission Flow
1. Select POI from map (risk band; distance; time; stealth tags)
2. Assemble squad: role suggestions; gear check; consumable quick-pick
3. Briefing card: objectives, timers, special infected warnings, recommended power
4. In-mission controls: drag-select, tap-to-move, radial wheel (focus fire, abilities, stance)
5. Extraction: choose safe vs. fast route (stealth vs. noise)
6. Debrief: XP, loot, injuries/infections, narrative choice if present

Accessibility:
- Turn-based toggle
- Aim assist and larger tap targets
- Left-hand mode and scalable UI

### Siege Flow (Horde Night)
1. Pre-alert (12–24h): Timer; suggested upgrades; preview lanes and specials
2. Prep phase: Place/repair traps; ammo/power check; assign defenders to posts
3. Defense phase: Multi-lane waves; elite specials telegraph; last-minute commands
4. Post-battle: Damage report; kill heatmap; resource loss; morale impact; event follow-ups

### Economy & Store UX
- Store focuses on cosmetics/QoL; clear labeling; no hidden power
- Battle pass: free/premium tracks; preview cosmetics on survivors/base
- Reward ads: optional; capped; natural placements (end-mission, daily cache)

### Meta Navigation
- Bottom nav: Base, Map, Survivors, Tech, Alliance, Store
- Secondary: Inventory, Journal (story + logs), Events
- Long-press inspect anywhere for contextual details
